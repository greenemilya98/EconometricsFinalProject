# Replicating Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001): “The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development”

## 1 Introduction: The Primacy of Institutions in Economic Development

A central question in the literature on economic growth is the origin of the vast differences in per capita income across countries. While theories emphasizing geography, culture, and integration have been proposed, Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001) [hereafter AJR] advance the institutions hypothesis: that differences in economic performance are primarily determined by differences in economic institutions that shape the incentives for investment and innovation. Specifically, institutions that secure property rights and constrain the power of elites are argued to be conducive to long-run prosperity.

A fundamental challenge in empirically testing this hypothesis is endogeneity. A simple OLS regression of income on a measure of institutional quality is likely to yield biased estimates due to omitted variables and, most critically, reverse causality—wealthier nations may be able to afford or may prefer to establish higher-quality institutions. To overcome this, AJR propose a robust identification strategy using an instrumental variable.

## 2. The Instrumental Variable Strategy

To establish a causal link, a valid instrument (Z) must satisfy two core conditions: relevance (Cov(Z,X)≠0) and the exclusion restriction (Cov(Z,ϵ)=0). AJR propose potential mortality rates of European settlers during the colonial period as an instrument for current institutional quality.

Their identification strategy rests on a causal chain that can be represented by a set of structural equations:

The main outcome equation, where economic performance is a function of current institutions:  
logyi=μ+αRi+X′iγ+ϵi  
Here, yi is income per capita, Ri is the measure of current institutions (protection against expropriation risk), and X′i is a vector of covariates.

The assumption of institutional persistence, where current institutions (Ri) are a function of early colonial institutions (Ci):  
Ri=λR+βRCi+X′iγR+νRi  

The link between settlements and the formation of early institutions, where early institutions (Ci) depend on the extent of European settlements (Si):  
Ci=λc+βCSi+X′iγC+νCi  

The first link in the causal chain, where the nature of settlements (Si) was determined by the mortality risk faced by settlers (logMi):  
Si=λS+βSlogMi+X′iγS+νSi  

The full causal path is thus:

Settler Mortality→Settlements→Early Institutions→Current Institutions→Current Economic Performance

The logic is that where the disease environment was favorable to European settlement (low mortality), colonists established “neo-Europes” with inclusive institutions focused on protecting property rights. Conversely, where mortality rates were high, they established “extractive states” with limited constraints on power, designed to plunder resources. AJR posit that these institutional frameworks persisted long after independence. The historical disease environment is argued to have no direct effect on modern income, satisfying the exclusion restriction.

The datasets used in this replication can be found on Daron Acemoglu’s MIT faculty page. The paper can be accessed from here.

The descriptive statistics in Table 1 reveal a strong, negative raw correlation between the instrument (settler mortality) and both the outcome (log GDP per capita) and the endogenous regressor (institutional quality). As we move from the lowest mortality quartile to the highest, average income and the average quality of institutions systematically decline. This provides initial, non-causal support for the relationships underlying the IV strategy.

NEW: To complement the descriptive patterns in Table 1, the scatterplots provide a direct visual assessment of the instrument's relevance (institutional quality). This directly addresses the first requirement for a valid IV strategy. Relevance requires that the instrument be sufficiently correlated with the endogenous regressor-—that is, Cov(Z,X) cannot be 0,where Z is settler mortality and X is institutional quality. Table 1 shows a strong, negative correlation between settler mortality and both institutional quality and income. The scatterplots demonstrate this relationship as well--as log settler mortality increases, the institutional quality measures decline along clear downward sloping patterns. This reinforces the idea that the historical disease environment is strongly correlated with modern institutions, making the IV relevant. Although the scatterplots do not establish causality, they provide a first-stage picture showing that the instrument contains meaningful variation for explaining institutional outcomes, supporting the case for an IV strategy.

# 4 OLS Regressions

The following code establishes a baseline correlation using OLS, regressing log GDP per capita on a measure of institutional quality (average protection against expropriation risk). These results serve as a benchmark against which the 2SLS estimates can be compared.

The OLS estimates consistently show a positive and statistically significant coefficient on institutional quality. However, as noted, these results are likely biased. The direction of the bias is ambiguous: omitted variables could bias the coefficient upwards or downwards, while reverse causality would likely lead to an upward bias. The subsequent IV estimates will be crucial for identifying the direction and magnitude of this net bias.

This table provides strong evidence for the first stage of the IV strategy. Panel A shows that settler mortality is a strong, negative, and significant predictor of current institutional quality. Panel B demonstrates the mechanism: settler mortality is a significant predictor of early institutional choices and the extent of European settlement. These results confirm the relevance of the instrument.

# 6 2SLS Estimates of Instituitons on Performance

The following code presents the central findings of the paper, reporting the two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimates of the causal effect of institutions on economic performance.

First Stage: The first stage regresses the endogenous variable (institutions) on the instrument (settler mortality) and any exogenous controls.

Riski=π0+π1log(Mortalityi)+π′2Xi+νi

Second Stage: The second stage regresses the outcome (log GDP) on the predicted values of institutions from the first stage, controlling for other exogenous factors.

Panel A shows a large, positive, and statistically significant causal effect of institutional quality on log GDP per capita. Notably, the 2SLS coefficient on institutions is substantially larger than the OLS coefficient from Table 2. This suggests that the OLS estimates were biased downwards, potentially due to measurement error in the institutions variable, which can cause attenuation bias. The results are robust across various subsamples. Panel B confirms the first-stage relationship is strong and significant in all specifications.

# 7 IV Regressions with Additional Controls

The following code begins to test the exclusion restriction by subjecting the baseline IV estimate to the inclusion of controls for other historical factors that could be correlated with colonial experience, such as colonial origin, legal origin, and religion.

The estimated causal effect of institutions on income remains large, significant, and remarkably stable after including these additional controls. This provides evidence against the hypothesis that the instrument is working through these alternative channels. The stability of the coefficient strengthens the argument that institutions are the primary causal mechanism.

# 8 Robustness Checks for IV Regressions

The following code further scrutinizes the exclusion restriction by testing the baseline result against a battery of geographic and resource-based variables. This directly confronts the competing “geography hypothesis” which posits that climate, disease, and resource endowments are the fundamental causes of prosperity.

The coefficient on institutions remains robust and significant even after controlling for temperature, humidity, soil quality, natural resources, and ethnolinguistic fragmentation. The table reports p-values for the joint significance of these groups of controls, which are generally insignificant. This result is a powerful rebuttal to the simple geography hypothesis, suggesting that geography’s primary influence on modern income was through its effect on historical institutional development.

## Geography and Health

The following code takes a look at the most plausible threat to the exclusion restriction: that settler mortality is not just a historical instrument but a proxy for a persistent disease environment that directly impacts health and productivity today. The analysis controls for modern health indicators like malaria prevalence and life expectancy.

Second Stage:

log(GDPi)=β0+β1Riskiˆ+β1Healthiˆ+ϵi

First Stage:

Riski=π0+π1Z1i+π2Z2i+νi

Healthi=δ0+δ1Z1i+δ2Z2i+ηi

where Healthi is a modern health outcome (e.g., malaria) and Z1 and Z2 are the instruments.

The causal effect of institutions remains large and significant when controlling for modern health variables. Furthermore, when health variables themselves are instrumented for (columns 7-9), they are not significant, while institutions remain so. This suggests that the historical disease environment’s effect on income is not primarily through a persistent local disease environment, but rather through its impact on the development of institutions.

# 9 Overidentification Tests

The final code block provides further tests of the IV strategy’s validity. It employs alternative historical variables as potential instruments and, by using multiple instruments simultaneously, performs tests of overidentifying restrictions (Sargan tests).

First Stage:  
Riski=π0+π1Z1i+π2Z2i+π′3Xi+νi  
log(GDPi)=β0+β1Riskˆi+β′2Xi+ϵi  

Here, Z1i is the main instrument (settler mortality) and Z2 is an additional instrument (e.g., early institutions). The Sargan test is then used to assess whether both instruments are uncorrelated with the error term, ϵi.

Panel C is the most critical. When settler mortality is used as an instrument alongside other plausible instruments (like early political institutions), the Sargan test fails to reject the null hypothesis that the instruments are valid (i.e., uncorrelated with the error term). This provides statistical evidence supporting the exclusion restriction. Panel D further shows that the main result is not driven by an outlier effect of settler mortality itself.

# 10 Conclusion

Through a robust and comprehensively tested instrumental variable strategy, this replication confirms the central finding of Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001). The evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that institutions that protect property rights and constrain elite power have a large, positive, and causal effect on long-run economic development. The paper effectively refutes purely geographic or cultural explanations, demonstrating instead that these factors likely had their greatest impact through their influence on the historical development of institutions. This work has fundamentally reshaped the field of development economics, placing institutional quality at the forefront of the discipline.
